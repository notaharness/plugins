# Adopt a running player: point its reports at an orchestrator and type the player skill
# invocation into its pane. Without trailing text the player treats it as a handoff and
# answers with a PROGRESS summary (or repeats DONE); with text, the text becomes its new task.
#
# Usage: adopt.sh <session> [--repo PATH] [--orchestrator codex:<thread-id>|tmux:<session>]
#                 [--agent claude|codex|...] [--machine NAME] [<text…>]
#                 --machine: the beam peer label or peerId the session is on; default
#                 $ORCHESTRA_MACHINE, else this machine. A remote --repo must be absolute or
#                 start with ~/.
# Inspect screen.sh first and adopt only players idle at their input prompt. The pane must be
# alive with an agent (not a shell) at the terminal; otherwise nothing is changed or typed.
# <session> is a branch (resolved in this repo, --repo, or uniquely across repos) or an exact
# tmux session name; only a session tagged as a player (@orchestra-spawner set,
# @orchestra-session-type worktree) is adopted, whoever created it. The target is written to the
# session's @orchestra-orchestrator tag, which report.sh reads; the player's own ORCHESTRA_SOCKET
# already names this server. Sessions without an @orchestra-agent tag default to Claude.
